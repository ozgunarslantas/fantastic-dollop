This is a random project written in React.js.

- I intended to write the project with typescript but then gave up as it is time consuming.
- Home page has a small example of the global state management tool of choice, Redux.
- Login page, NonHome page and Home page are the routes of the app. Also, there is a 404 page which all pages apart from the aforementioned three get redirected to. React Router is used for routing.
- The small login quiz demonstrates the ajax requests, which are made via axios.
